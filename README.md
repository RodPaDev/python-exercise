# Python Exercices

In order for things to go smoothly we'll follow the workflow I'm going to detail below.

But before, it's important for you to watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqmSzXDrJBk)

1. Fork the repository by clicking the fork button on the gihtub repo. [Learn how here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository)

2. Clone the forked repository to your computer using https. [Follow these steps](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository-using-the-command-line) 

    Note: Step 4, you can also use Windows Powershell

3. Next you're going to checkout to a new branch and set it's name to the file you're currently working on.
    
    `git checkout -b BRANCH-NAME`

4. And you're going to work on your branch

5. When you're happy with the results stage, commit and push your branch to github

    `git add exercise-fileName.py`

    `git commit exercise-fileName.py -m "Finished Exercices"`

    `git push origin BRANCH-NAME`

6. After that DM me to let me know
