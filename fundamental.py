## 1. Write functions for the following operations add, subtract, multiply, divide 
## The function should take two parameters: number1, number2 and return the value of the operation

## 2. Finish the following function that does all of the arithmethic operations above by using logic statement, it should return the value of the operation

def evaluate(arithmeticOperation, num1, num2):
    pass

## 3. Write a function that determines whether a number is odd or even

## I do not expect fot you to understand these concepets right away but diving into them beforehand 
## will allow you to understand it easier next time you encounter these concepts.
## If it helps you can write an example along with your explanation in code by adding comments like so:

someVarialbe = 'some complicated concept' ## this is the comment explaining my thought
